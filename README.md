          I completed the challenges of the first weeks and it went fairly well. Regarding the data preparation, I've attempted preparing and cleaning my data and in my [personal challenge](https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/blob/main/Documentation/Personal%20Challenge/Home%20appraisal.ipynb). I did this by removing the unnecessary text or signs in a column. For example, in the column of Rooms, the data would be 5 bedrooms. I removed the "bedrooms", so I could read it as numerical.
