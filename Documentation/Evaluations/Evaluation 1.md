          I completed the exercises of the first weeks and it went fairly well. Regarding the data preparation, I've attempted preparing and cleaning my data and in my <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/blob/main/Documentation/Personal%20Challenge/Home%20appraisal.ipynb">personal challenge</a>. I did this by removing the unnecessary text or signs in a column. For example, in the column of Rooms, the data would be 5 bedrooms. I removed the "bedrooms", so I could read it as numerical. Since I completed the exercises and iteration 0, I would consider myself orienting on this learning outcome.

## Model Engineering

         I also did all of the exercises of machine learning in the first weeks. I think I have a basic understanding of what is happening, but I need to understand the concept of the models behind it better. I began with nearest neighbors in my <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/blob/main/Documentation/Personal%20Challenge/Home%20appraisal.ipynb">personal challenge</a>. Since I am working on it but have a really basic understanding, I would classify it as orienting for now.

## Explainable AI

    <th><strong>Learning Outcome</strong></th>
    <td>"You deliver AI projects that follow the three 'Explainable AI' principles of transparency, interpretability, and explainability."</td>

        <p>
          In the exercises of both DAIA and Machine Learning, I always try to explain why I did specific things. In my personal challenge this becomes even clearer due to the clear headings and explanation. The explanation could be better in some cases, so that is why I consider this learning outcome as orienting.

## Professional Standard

  <tr>
    <th><strong>Learning Outcome</strong></th>
    <td>"You show that you conduct work in accordance with an industry supported methodological approach (AI Project Methodology) in terms of your project's goals, stakeholder involvement, applied research, decision making and reporting."</td>

        <p>
         The AI Project Methodology is new to me, so I am trying to use it. I completed iteration 0 for my <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/blob/main/Documentation/Personal%20Challenge/Home%20appraisal.ipynb">personal challenge</a> according to the AI Project Methodology. While I do think I did a good job on it, I should document it in a way so my stakeholders can see what steps have been taken during the project.

## Personal Leadership
<table>
  <tr>
    <th><strong>Learning Outcome</strong></th>
    <td>"You are aware of your strengths and pitfalls in ICT as well as your personal development. To nurture personal growth you are able to engage in actions that align with your core values, in a way that suits you. "</td>
  </tr>

    <td>
        <p>          
          I think this is really one of the stronger aspects for me. I am not scared to ask questions if something is not yet clear for me and I won't shy away to be the first one to ask for feedback. I understand the importance of feedback, but I could discuss a little bit more with my fellow students, such as what they have for domain understanding or PDR. As of now, I would say it is on orienting, but towards beginning.
