          I completed the given exercises for data cleaning. In my <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/blob/main/Documentation/Personal%20Challenge/Home%20appraisal.ipynb">personal challenge</a>, I cleaned my data by:</br>
            - Removing non-numerical values (€ and Prijs op aanvraag) from the Price column </br>
            - Removing m2 from the Lot size column</br>
            - Removing m2 from the Living space size column</br>
            - Removing non-numerical values (Voor 1906 and Na 2020) from the Build year column</br>
            - Splitting the multiple values in Rooms in Total rooms and Bedrooms</br>
            - Splitting the multiple values in Toilet in Bathrooms and Toilets</br>
            - Changing the Energy label to numerical values</br>
            - Removing the values where Energy label is "Niet verplicht'</br>
          </br>
          Ofcourse I also made a heatmap to show correlations between the features: </br>

          There is still some work to do, such as adding more features and aligning the features at the bottom.

## Model Engineering

          I completed all of the exercises for both DAIA and Machine Learning and always try to explain what happens and why I am doing it. In my personal challenge, I did my feature selection by the knowledge I gained from my research, interview and heatmap combined. I used kNN in my personal project, however, I do want to change the model as I think kNN is not the best model to use for me.

## Explainable AI

    <th><strong>Learning Outcome</strong></th>
    <td>"You deliver AI projects that follow the three 'Explainable AI' principles of transparency, interpretability, and explainability."</td>

    <th><strong>Proficiency Rating</strong></th>
    <td>Orienting</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><strong>Explanation</strong></th>
    <td>
        <p>
          In the exercises of both DAIA and Machine Learning, I always try to explain why I did specific things. In my personal challenge this becomes even clearer due to the clear headings and explanation. The explanation could be better in some cases, so that is why I consider this learning outcome as orienting.

## Professional Standard

    <td>"You show that you conduct work in accordance with an industry supported methodological approach (AI Project Methodology) in terms of your project's goals, stakeholder involvement, applied research, decision making and reporting."</td>

        <p>
         I am still getting bit used to the AI methodology. However, I think my documentation is much better for research and the interview with the stakeholder. I also keep my stakeholder more in the loop with the improvements, since the interview was held.

## Personal Leadership

    <th><strong>Learning Outcome</strong></th>

        <p>          
          I think this is really one of the stronger aspects for me. I am not scared to ask questions if something is not yet clear for me and I won't shy away to be the first one to ask for feedback. One of my biggest pitfalls is unjustified self-doubt. I tend to set the standards quite high for myself, but sometimes the highest standard is simply not achievable.
