          I completed the given exercises for data cleaning. In the exercises I mainly focussed on the missing values at first. I found out that replacing the value by the mean or mode would be the best option, but I dont know which one works best for each scenario.</br>
Niek also agreed on this: <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/blob/main/Documentation/Feedback.md">"Did you also check what the effect is of replacing missing values with mean or mode? And can you explain WHY it is important or needed to fill the missing values with actual values, or could deletion also be an option?"</a> 
</br>
  </br>
          Altough I had some difficulties with the exercises, I think I managed to clean the data in my personal challenge quite well.</br>
          In my <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/blob/main/Documentation/Personal%20Challenge/Home%20appraisal.ipynb">personal             
          challenge</a>, I've attempted to clean my data to the point that a heatmap could be created.
          I made the heatmap to show correlations between the features: </br>

          There is still some work to do, such as adding more features and aligning the features at the bottom.

## Model Engineering

          I completed all of the exercises for both DAIA and Machine Learning and always try to explain what happens and why I am doing it. I begin to understand the models and their concept better. 
          I also understand the problem of overfitting.</br>
  Jacco agrees: <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/blob/main/Documentation/Feedback.md">"You have performed cross-validation correctly and understand there might be problems with overfitting."</a>
          </br> 
          </br> 
          In my personal challenge, I did my feature selection by the knowledge I gained from my research, interview and heatmap combined. I used kNN in my personal project, however, I do want to change the model as I think kNN is not the best model to use for me.

## Explainable AI

          In the exercises of both DAIA and Machine Learning, I always try to explain why I did specific things.</br>
          Jacco also agrees on for example the Decision tree exercise: <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/blob/main/Documentation/Feedback.md">"You clearly explain the parameters of the decision tree algorithm and understand the importance of overfitting." </a></br>
          In my personal challenge this becomes even clearer due to the clear headings and explanation. I feel like the explanation could be better for DAIA.</br>
          Niek agrees on this according to the following feedback: <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/blob/main/Documentation/Feedback.md">"And can you explain WHY it is important ..."</a>

         I am still getting bit used to the AI methodology. However, I think my documentation is much better for research and the interview with the stakeholder. I also keep my stakeholder more in the loop with the improvements, since the interview was held.

## Personal Leadership

          I think this is really one of the stronger aspects for me. I am not scared to ask questions if something is not yet clear for me and I won't shy away to be the first one to ask for feedback. One of my biggest pitfalls is unjustified self-doubt. I tend to set the standards quite high for myself, but sometimes the highest standard is simply not achievable.
