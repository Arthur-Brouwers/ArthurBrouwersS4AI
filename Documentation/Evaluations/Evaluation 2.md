          I completed the given exercises for data cleaning. In my <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/blob/main/Documentation/Personal%20Challenge/Home%20appraisal.ipynb">personal challenge</a>, I cleaned my data by:</br>
            - Removing non-numerical values (€ and Prijs op aanvraag) from the Price column </br>
            - Removing m2 from the Lot size column</br>
            - Removing m2 from the Living space size column</br>
            - Removing non-numerical values (Voor 1906 and Na 2020) from the Build year column</br>
            - Splitting the multiple values in Rooms in Total rooms and Bedrooms</br>
            - Splitting the multiple values in Toilet in Bathrooms and Toilets</br>
            - Changing the Energy label to numerical values</br>
            - Removing the values where Energy label is "Niet verplicht'</br>
          </br>
          Ofcourse I also made a heatmap to show correlations between the features: </br>

          There is still some work to do, such as adding more features and aligning the features at the bottom.

## Model Engineering

          I completed all of the exercises for both DAIA and Machine Learning and always try to explain what happens and why I am doing it. In my personal challenge, I did my feature selection by the knowledge I gained from my research, interview and heatmap combined. I used kNN in my personal project, however, I do want to change the model as I think kNN is not the best model to use for me.

## Explainable AI

  <tr>
    <th><strong>Learning Outcome</strong></th>
    <td>"You deliver AI projects that follow the three 'Explainable AI' principles of transparency, interpretability, and explainability."</td>

    <th><strong>Proficiency Rating</strong></th>
    <td>Orienting</td>

  <tr>
    <th><strong>Explanation</strong></th>
    <td>
        <p>
          In the exercises of both DAIA and Machine Learning, I always try to explain why I did specific things. In my personal challenge this becomes even clearer due to the clear headings and explanation. The explanation could be better in some cases, so that is why I consider this learning outcome as orienting.

         The AI Project Methodology is new to me, so I am trying to use it. I completed iteration 0 for my <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/blob/main/Documentation/Personal%20Challenge/Home%20appraisal.ipynb">personal challenge</a> according to the AI Project Methodology. While I do think I did a good job on it, I should document it in a way so my stakeholders can see what steps have been taken during the project.

## Personal Leadership

          I think this is really one of the stronger aspects for me. I am not scared to ask questions if something is not yet clear for me and I won't shy away to be the first one to ask for feedback. I understand the importance of feedback, but I could discuss a little bit more with my fellow students, such as what they have for domain understanding or PDR. As of now, I would say it is on orienting, but towards beginning.
