        In response to <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/blob/main/Documentation/Feedback.md#personal-challenge-feedback">Niek Schmitz's feedback</a>, I significantly expanded my data exploration, creating a comprehensive Data Understanding chapter. This addresses the need to understand the existing data before applying changes. The enhanced data exploration involved more visualizations, providing a deeper understanding of the dataset. This improvement aligns with the "Proficient" rating for data preparation and analysis.

          In my personal challenge, I utilized various models, including Nearest Neighbours, Linear Regression, Clustering, and Random Forest. I adapted my approach based on the <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/blob/main/Documentation/Feedback.md#personal-challenge-feedback">feedback from Niek Schmitz and Jacco Snoeren.</a> For instance, Niek's suggestion to explore clustering for more accurate predictions prompted me to explore this avenue, even though it did not yield significant results due to the dataset's size. The final implementation with Random Forest demonstrated an R2 of 79, surpassing the set accuracy goal. These adjustments and responsiveness to teacher feedback contribute to the "Proficient" rating in model engineering.

          In my personal challenge, <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/blob/main/Documentation/Feedback.md#personal-challenge-feedback">I received positive feedback from Jacco Snoeren (15th December)</a> regarding my clear explanations and understanding of the algorithms' internal workings. I highlighted the three explainable AI principles in my open programme where additionaly I wrote a reflection on explainable AI. Furthermore, Nick Welman (15th December) acknowledged the clarity in my comments and explanations. Although there was room for improvement in explaining the models' inner workings, I actively addressed this feedback, resulting in enhanced transparency and interpretability. The combination of positive feedback and continuous improvement efforts led to a proficiency level deemed "Proficient" in Explainable AI.
