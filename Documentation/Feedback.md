# Feedback
Here is the feedback I got from my teachers over the weeks devided by subject and week:

| Week | Machine Learning | Societal Impact | Data Analytics & Investigative Analysis |
|------|------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1    | <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/tree/main/Documentation/Exercises/Machine%20Learning/Weeks/Week%201">You saw correctly that the results are different</a> because of the train/test split. Do you know how to make them stable as well? <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/tree/main/Documentation/Exercises/Machine%20Learning/Weeks/Week%201">You correctly changed the features and concluded that it did not improve the results. you correctly explain why adding a third feature will give slightly worse results. You correctly conclude that changing n_neighbours gives different results and understand what's happening</a>. You're very lucky you got 100% accuracy for 5 neighbours!|<a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/tree/main/Documentation/Exercises/Societal%20Impact/Weeks/Week%201"> Never use if in a a project proposal conclusion</a>, but a definitive yes or no. Don't have too many fantasies in your proposal</a>| Your ratings and comments are similar to CÃ©dric's.... so my feedback will be the same too :) Of course you can work together, but try to submit your unique notebook, so I can see your individual skills... Try to relate your arguments clearly to the 3 learning outcomes. <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/tree/main/Documentation/Exercises/Data%20Analytics%20%26%20Investigative%20Analysis/Weeks/Week%201">Most of your remarks are about the graphs, but also consider the other elements of data provisioning (and also think about how oyu would improve that)</a>. I hope you now have an idea of what a basic notebook looks like and what is important to include/improve.</a>|
| 2    | You performed the tests for normal distribution. You conclude they are, but it's also not entirely clear from the dataset. Especially for the more expensive cars probably they are not normally distributed. <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/tree/main/Documentation/Exercises/Machine%20Learning/Weeks/Week%202">You did the explainability exercise well. You compared the two models well and came up with the correct conclusion.</a> | The structure of the cognitive scheme was good. <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/tree/main/Documentation/Exercises/Societal%20Impact/Weeks/Week%202">Our conclusion of what we had learned was Excellent</a>. Our conclusion was: You should do research even if you think you know the answer. | <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/tree/main/Documentation/Exercises/Data%20Analytics%20%26%20Investigative%20Analysis/Weeks/Week%202">No feedback</a>|
| 3    | <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/tree/main/Documentation/Exercises/Machine%20Learning/Weeks/Week%203">You correctly removed Cherbourg from the features.</a> Do you also see that removing it reduces the complexity of the algorithm? You applied decision trees on the iris dataset correctly. <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/tree/main/Documentation/Exercises/Machine%20Learning/Weeks/Week%203">You clearly explain the parameters of the decision tree algorithm and understand the importance of overfitting.</a> | <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/tree/main/Documentation/Exercises/Societal%20Impact/Weeks/Week%203">No feedback</a>| Good job, with the 4 of you you have created a first version, so now you can work from this point on to improve it regularly. Although you might have more questions than answers at this stage, you have create a first structure as starting point. It helps you to identify assumptions, raise more in-dpeth questions and of course, to start listing and descirbing the data elements you need. Looking at the headers, you have addressed some of the relevant aspects, but make sure in next versions you will go into more details. E.g. For the quality criteria, you can make your first considerations more concrete (how do you capture consistency or accuracy in a data requirement?) and once you have started to explore data (sources) you might come up with an addition to this part. You have started to make an overview of data elements, and you good broader than just the highway traffic. That is good, but makes sure you can explain why rain forecast or temperature is relevant (how is it connected to you rtarget variable?). And maybe there is more, such as fog or holidays? <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/tree/main/Documentation/Exercises/Data%20Analytics%20%26%20Investigative%20Analysis/Weeks/Week%203">If you don't know if a requirement is valid or necesarry (yet), than add a comment or note and check or revise this in a later stage.</a> Everytime you explore or analyse the data, you might need to update the requirements as well. <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/tree/main/Documentation/Exercises/Data%20Analytics%20%26%20Investigative%20Analysis/Weeks/Week%203">For coming weeks: try to make the data elements more specific/detailed: think about how to include date/time aspects in order to link the data elements...</a> Weather measures/units can also be more specific. Maybe it helps to give some examples of how this data looks like and how you would use it? E.g. is temperature the daily mean, or high/low temperature? And why you need Day if you also have Date as variable? In conclusion: this exercise was meant to help to to get started, and that is what you've done. of course, it is not a complete or perfect overview of data requirements yet; you have to keep working on that for the coming weeks, but as the start is sometimes the most difficult, you now have something to move forward from. Feel free to discuss further work or progress with me! |
| 4    | I see you made an attempt on the exercise, very good! <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/blob/main/Documentation/Exercises/Machine%20Learning/Weeks/Arthur-iris-clustering.html">It's very hard to determine what you did without context</a> though, so maybe we can discuss it in person.|                 | Hi Arthur, good to see you have worked on the exercise. I see you have focussed on the missing values. That is something we will explain/talk about next week in the DAIA session. <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/blob/main/Documentation/Exercises/Data%20Analytics%20%26%20Investigative%20Analysis/Weeks/wk4%20DAIA_datacleaning_exercise%20(2).html">However, there are more errors/flaws in this dataset to fix.</a> I see you have addressed the mentioning of Million/billion, but the scaling for million is the same as when million is not found... so <a href="https://github.com/Arthur-Brouwers/ArthurBrouwersS4AI/blob/main/Documentation/Exercises/Data%20Analytics%20%26%20Investigative%20Analysis/Weeks/wk4%20DAIA_datacleaning_exercise%20(2).html">make sure you define a clear 'rule' before fixing the violations</a> (think of the slides explaning how to clean).|
