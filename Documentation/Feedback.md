# Feedback
Here is the feedback I got from my teachers over the weeks devided by subject and week:

| Week | Machine Learning | Societal Impact | Data Analytics & Investigative Analysis |
|------|------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1    | You saw correctly that the results are different because of the train/test split. Do you know how to make them stable as well? You correctly changed the features and concluded that it did not improve the results. you correctly explain why adding a third feature will give slightly worse results. You correctly conclude that changing n_neighbours gives different results and understand what's happening. You're very lucky you got 100% accuracy for 5 neighbours!| Never use if in a a project proposal conclusion, but a definitive yes or no. Don't have too many fantasies in your proposal| Your ratings and comments are similar to CÃ©dric's.... so my feedback will be the same too :) Of course you can work together, but try to submit your unique notebook, so I can see your individual skills... Try to relate your arguments clearly to the 3 learning outcomes. Most of your remarks are about the graphs, but also consider the other elements of data provisioning (and also think about how oyu would improve that). I hope you now have an idea of what a basic notebook looks like and what is important to include/improve.|
| 2    | You performed the tests for normal distribution. You conclude they are, but it's also not entirely clear from the dataset. Especially for the more expensive cars probably they are not normally distributed. You did the explainability exercise well. You compared the two models well and came up with the correct conclusion. | The structure of the cognitive scheme was good. Our conclusion of what we had learned was Excellent. Our conclusion was: You should do research even if you think you know the answer. |                                        |
